Selecting the appropriate company type in the UK is crucial, especially if you plan to apply for immigration in the future. Your choice can significantly influence your eligibility for various visa routes, each with its own requirements and implications. Here's a comprehensive guide to help you navigate this decision:

## üè¢ Choosing the Right Company Structure

In the UK, the most common business structures are:

* **Sole Trader**: Suitable for individuals running a business alone. However, this structure may not align well with immigration pathways that require a formal business entity.

* **Partnership**: Ideal for two or more individuals sharing responsibilities. Similar to sole traders, partnerships might not meet the criteria for certain visa categories.

* **Limited Company (Ltd)**: A separate legal entity from its owners, offering limited liability protection. This structure is often preferred for immigration purposes due to its formal recognition and compliance with regulatory standards.

For immigration considerations, establishing a **Limited Company** is generally advisable, as it aligns with the requirements of various business-related visa routes.
