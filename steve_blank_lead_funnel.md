# The Steve Blank-Inspired Lead Funnel: A Customer Development Approach

This document outlines a lead funnel based on Steve Blank's Customer Development framework. This is not a traditional sales funnel, but a process for learning, validating, and scaling your business model.

## The Four Stages of the Customer Development Funnel

The funnel is divided into the four core stages of the Customer Development framework:

1.  **Customer Discovery:** Do we have a problem worth solving?
2.  **Customer Validation:** Have we built a solution people will buy?
3.  **Customer Creation:** How do we scale our customer base?
4.  **Company Building:** How do we transition to a scalable organization?

### 1. Customer Discovery: Finding Problem/Solution Fit

**Goal:** To validate that you are solving a meaningful problem for a specific customer segment.

**"Leads" in this stage:** Potential interviewees, industry experts, and anyone who can provide insight into the problem space.

| **Get Out of the Building:** Conduct interviews with potential customers. | Gain a deep understanding of their pain points and workflow. | Number of customer interviews conducted. |
