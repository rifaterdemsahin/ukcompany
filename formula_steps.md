Setting up a UK company as a Turkish citizen (non-UK resident) is very possible and relatively straightforward. Below are the clear steps, legal considerations, and helpful tips tailored for you:

⸻

✅ 1. Choose Company Type

For most entrepreneurs, the best option is:
	•	Private Limited Company (Ltd) — Limited liability, easy to register, widely accepted.

⸻

✅ 2. Choose a Company Name
	•	Must be unique and end with “Ltd” or “Limited”.
	•	You can check availability at: https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company-name-availability

⸻

✅ 3. Appoint Directors & Shareholders

You’ll need:
	•	At least one director (you can be the sole director & shareholder)
	•	No need to be a UK resident
	•	You must be 18+ and not disqualified from being a director

⸻

✅ 4. UK Registered Office Address

You must have a UK address for the company (not a PO box). It will appear on public records.

✅ You can use a virtual office service for this, which costs ~£10–£20/month
Examples:
	•	1st Formations
	•	Hoxton Mix
	•	Your Company Formations

⸻

✅ 5. Register with Companies House

You can register online in 15–30 minutes.

Options:
	•	Direct: https://www.gov.uk/limited-company-formation (£12)
	•	Through formation agent (easier for non-residents): £30–£100

⸻

✅ 6. Get a UK Business Bank Account

UK banks often require:
	•	Proof of identity and address (passport, utility bill)
	•	Business details

Non-resident options:
	•	Wise Business (formerly TransferWise) — Easiest
	•	Revolut Business
	•	Payoneer (limited)
	•	Tide (if you have UK address & phone)

You don’t need a UK visa to open these accounts if you use Wise or Revolut.

⸻

✅ 7. Register for Taxes (if applicable)
	•	Corporation Tax: Automatically enrolled upon company creation.
	•	VAT: If revenue exceeds £90,000/year or if selling to UK businesses.
	•	PAYE: Only if you employ someone (including yourself).

⸻

✅ 8. Maintain Compliance

You’ll need to:
	•	File confirmation statement annually
	•	File company accounts and corporation tax return
	•	Keep records (invoices, expenses, etc.)

⸻

⚠ Legal Notes for Turkish Nationals
	•	No UK residency or visa is required to own or direct a UK company.
	•	Having a UK-based accountant helps ensure compliance.
	•	If planning to move to the UK, business ownership does not automatically grant you a visa, but:
	•	Innovator Founder visa or Self-Sponsorship visa options exist (contact a UK immigration lawyer if needed).

⸻

💼 Optional: Hire an Accountant

A UK-based accountant helps with:
	•	Tax filing
	•	Payroll (if needed)
	•	VAT setup and compliance

⸻
